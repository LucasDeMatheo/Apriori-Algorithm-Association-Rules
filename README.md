# Apriori-Algorithm-Association-Rules
Do you know the relationship between Beer and Diaper sales? What would be the relationship between two different categories sales?

Well, this story was attributed to a great success case of Data Science applied to retail chains. The Algorithm was able to point out the correlation between the sales of these two products by analyzing patterns in customer purchase data. Since correlation does not imply causality, the retailer investigated this case further, getting closer and closer to an answer: The customers were largely men who, when buying diapers for their children, also buy beers to watch broadcasted sport games while taking care of the children. Thus, the retail opted for bringing the diaper shelves closer to the beer shelves, increasing the sales.

This case became quite famous and is used as an object of study to this day. There are several algorithms in Data Science and Analytics that address this topic (association rules), many of which are ready to be applied in a properly treated database.

Here, I show one of these algorithms, known as “A priori”, that I developed from scratch, only with the ideas and concepts presented to me, in the data mining discipline. It was a huge learning experience to develop an algorithm step by step, mainly for learning about the algorithm and programming in Python.

The “A priori” algorithm is widely used to determine association rules that highlight general trends in the data. At the end of the script, I used one of the algorithms that are already ready for application.

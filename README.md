Do you know the relationship between Beer and Diaper sales? What would be the relationship between the sales of two products in such different categories? Well, this story was attributed to a great success case of Data Mining applied to retail chains, which was able to point out the correlation between the sales of these two products by analyzing patterns in the data of their customers' purchases. As correlation does not imply causality, the retail chain investigated this case further, getting closer and closer to an answer. The customers were largely men who, when buying diapers for their children, bought the beers to look after the children while watching the weekend games. Thus, the retailer chose to bring the diaper shelves closer to the beers, increasing its sales.
